	 *
	 * An instance of this class manages a single widget and moves it
	 * automatically after the widget has been resized, so that it stays
	 * inside the given rectangle. The autoresize mixin never tries
	 * to resize the widget itself (despite the name perhaps).
	 *
	 * This class also tries to keep a corner of the managed widget near
	 * a given point passed to the constructor. This is useful when the
	 * widget pops up in response to some mouse-initiated action so that
	 * it appears near the mouse cursor.
	 *
	 * Most commonly this function is used to keep various popup widgets
	 * on screen, but it can also be used to prefer showing some popup
	 * inside the LeechCraft window, for example.
	 *
	 * The rectangle into which the widget should be embedded is obtained
	 * via a functor returning the rectangle. The functor is invoked each
	 * time the widget is to be refit.
